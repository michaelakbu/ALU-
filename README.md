# ALU-
16-bit ALU with arithmetic and logical operations 

This program is written in Verilog and is used to simulate the operation of an ALU but in 16 bits. 
These files contain different operations written in each module, which is imported into the main ALU file. 
There the modules are controlled via a case statement to carry out a arithmetic or logical operation depending on it's opcode.
